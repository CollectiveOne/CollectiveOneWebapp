This software is developed as part of an [open project in CollectiveOne](http://www.collectiveone.org/#/app/inits/ac119496-5e3e-1db5-815e-3f192a890001) to which anyone can potentially contribute. It includes a [contribution recognition system](http://www.collectiveone.org/#/app/inits/ac119496-5e3e-1db5-815e-3f192a890001/people) to recognize its contributors and the ownership of this software is shared amont the contributors proportionally to their contributions.

If you would like to contribute, you are more than welcome to do it! as you would for any open source project. The difference is that your contributions to CollectiveOne will be recognized using a project-specific token and this will grant you both ownership and power rights over the project. With time, we want CollectiveOne to be a fully decentralized project governed by its contributors and community.

For the moment, the CollectiveOne project, as owner of this software, grants limited permissions for its use, which are
- Download the software to make local tests and personalized patches.
- Run the software in web server to which a maximum of 100 different users have access.

All other uses of the sottware, in particular runing it on a web server accessible to more than 100 users, either for-profit or not, is forbidden.

CollectiveOne will, nevertheless, be open to provide licenses for deployments to more than 100 users on a case-by-case basis and for organizations with a special social purposes or non-profits.
